# TypeShift game built using Lightning Web Components

[TypeShift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeShift) is a word puzzle video game in which the player must spell out words by sliding letters in columns (by sliding the columns up and down). I've used [Lightning Web Components](https://lwc.dev) to build a version of this game, which you can play using the link below.  

## How to play?

Navigate to [this Heroku App](https://typeshift-lwc.herokuapp.com/). Use any of the game code(s) below to start playing.

1. Get familiar with the game and controls: `example`.
1. Game Codes for Level 1 (Find first/last names of popular CEOs): `ceo1`, `ceo2`.
1. Game Codes for Level 2 (Find country names): `country1`, `country2`.
1. Game Codes for Level 3 (Find Salesforce terms): `sf1`, `sf2`.

Slide the columns, and once you think you found a word, click on **Check Word**.
